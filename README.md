# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Interview Assessment
During the interview assessment, I successfully completed most of the tasks assigned, creating a product list and a product picker with various features. However, two functionalities remained incomplete: the drag and drop feature in the product list and pagination in the search function of the product picker.

Components Developed:

I worked on two components for the assessment:

Product List: This component enables users to sort and filter products based on various options. I implemented features for organizing and customizing products.
Product Picker: The product picker component allows users to search for products using a search bar and select them.
Implemented Features:

Discounts: Implemented discounts on the product level, recognizing the need to extend this functionality to the variant level to accommodate different discount ranges for various variants.
Displaying Discounted Prices: Previously, only discounted numbers were shown, but now, discounted prices are also displayed for better clarity.
Challenges Faced:

Drag and Drop Feature: I attempted to incorporate the drag and drop functionality using react-dnd but encountered challenges and ultimately opted for a static interface due to time constraints. However, the react-dnd package remains part of the dependencies as it was tested during development.
Suggestions for Improvement:

UI/UX Enhancements: Enhance the color combinations for a better user experience.
Quantity Counter: Introduce a quantity counter in the product list to allow users to increase or decrease the quantity of selected products.
Performance Optimization: Implement Skeleton CSS for smoother transitions and lazy loading for improved performance, especially with large product lists.
UI Library Integration: Consider integrating a UI library to streamline styling efforts and maintain consistency throughout the application.
